# Description of Video Part 1 \\
This video provides an overview of the automated assembly line, showcasing the layout of sensors, electrical buttons, counter displays, machines, and conveyors. It is followed by a presentation of the control logic implemented using the Control I/O interface in Factory I/O. The video first introduces the system's operational flow, then transitions to the Control I/O panel to explain the program structure, I/O mapping, and the sequencing logic. The control program utilizes key automation functions such as Set/Reset latches, counters, on-delay and off-delay timers, as well as rising and falling edge triggers â€” all coordinated to manage the assembly and batch packaging process.
